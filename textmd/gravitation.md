# Gravitation

The problem of reconciling quantum mechanics and gravitation as described by Einstein's general theory of relativity is currently unsolved, and introduces many obstacles.

The Bohmian perspective in general provides a fruitful avenue toward this reconciliation, because matter (particles) at least has a specific physical location at all times.  However, given that these are point particles, they represent a gravitational singularity, which must be resolved, in the same way that the EM singularity is resolved by adopting a finite physical scale of the the underlying cellular automaton grid (i.e., the _matrix_).

As this grid size gets smaller, the strength of gravitational effects increase, putting greater pressure on the need to incorporate gravitation as a central element of the framework.  So what considerations help us fix this fundamental grid scale?  In general, we can "renormalize" the constants to accommodate any such scale, so we need physical data to provide relevant constraints.

## Constraints from Cosmology

Cosmological considerations provide one source of important constraints, because various calculations could enable us to infer how dense matter must have been at the moment of the big bang, and from this we can potentially set a grid scale capable of representing this density.  Indeed, the big bang itself can be seen as a consequence of the accumulation of matter / energy up to the point of maximal density, through the merger of ever larger black holes, at which point somehow the gravitational process reverses and everything blows up again.  This is a [cyclic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model) (wikipedia link) of cosmology, of which many forms have been developed.

A particularly relevant line of work from Nikodem Popławski, building on earlier work from Kopczyński (1972) in the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity (Hehl et al, 1976).  This form of gravity adds a coupling of the spin component of a fermion particle to the gravitational metric tensor, which ends up being a significant net repulsive force when the density of fermions goes up (Popalawski 2010; 2012; 2016). This repulsive force would prevent a black hole from fully collapsing into a singularity, and instead it would "bounce" or oscillate as the mass / energy  attractive gravitational force interacts with this repulsive force. 

Popalawski (2012) gives the following estimates for the big bang parameters:

* critical radius ≈ 5.9 × 10−4 m

* momentum associated with the critical temperature: v(T_cr) ≈ 8.9 × 10^34

Popalawski (2010) defines the Cartan radius of an electron to be on the order of $10^{-27} m$, which sets a minimum spatial scale for such a particle. The density of electrons all packed together at this radius would be $ρ = m_e / r^3 = 10^{51} kg m^{−3}$.

## Planck scale

Another approach is to consider the Planck scale, where all the units involved in the gravitational equations take on a value of 1, which sets the Planck length on the order of $10^{-35} m$.  See [Physics Forums](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/hand-wavy-discussion-planck-length/) and [John Baez Lengths](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lengths.html) more info.  At this length scale, the gravitational force immediately surrounding an electron is as strong as its EM force.  The smallest length that has been empirically measured, according to above link, is about $10^{-22} m$, which is well below the Compton wavelength of an electron (order $10^{-13}$).

## The Extreme Coincidence of Flat Space

Nothing in the math of general relativity requires that the overall spacetime metric of the universe be flat, and yet it is.  In the standard inflationary big bang model of cosmology, a very precise set of parameters is required to end up with a flat result.  The idea that flat spacetime just a coincidental consequence of these specific initial conditions seems to be missing a huge opportunity for understanding that the universe seems to telling us very clearly: **spacetime is flat because space is fundamental**.  Space is not just some arbitrary mathematical construct, but rather it is the substrate upon which physics operates, as captured in the cellular automaton (CA) framework.  And flat spacetime is the natural consequence of the simplest cubic tiling of 3D space.

Because we populate our CA space with waves, this underlying cubic structure disappears, and physics behaves in an invariant manner across reference frames, consistent with relativity.  But the fact that it is so implausibly flat seems to be crying out for a deeper explanation.  Also, the need for renormalization and to avoid all manner of singularities and infinities that arise in the limit of infintessimal, continuous space, strongly suggests that there is an "ultraviolet" cutoff: space is not continuous, but discrete, with a minimum underlying grid size.  It seems possible to discern what this grid size is, by appropriate consideration of cosmology and proper integration of EM and gravitational forces.
